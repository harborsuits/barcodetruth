# BarcodeTruth System Status Report
**Generated:** 2025-01-XX  
**Purpose:** Complete system overview for external developers/consultants

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

BarcodeTruth is a consumer-facing app that helps users make values-aligned purchasing decisions by scanning product barcodes and viewing brand ethics scores. The system combines:
- Frontend React app (barcode scanning, brand profiles, personalized scoring)
- Supabase backend (auth, database, edge functions)
- Data pipeline (news ingestion, score calculation, brand enrichment)

**Current State:** Core infrastructure is solid, but several critical data gaps prevent full end-to-end functionality.

---

## üü¢ WORKING: Stripe Integration

### What Works
- **Stripe Edge Functions:** Deployed and functional
  - `create-checkout`: Creates checkout sessions
  - `check-subscription`: Verifies active subscriptions
  - `customer-portal`: Manages subscription portal access
  
- **Frontend Integration:**
  - `useSubscription` hook fetches subscription status
  - `useScanLimit` hook enforces free tier (5 scans/month) and unlimited for subscribers
  - Settings page allows users to manage subscriptions via Stripe portal

- **Database Tables:**
  - `user_billing`: Tracks subscription status
  - `stripe_customers`: Maps users to Stripe customer IDs
  - `stripe_events`: Logs webhook events
  - `user_scans`: Records scan activity for limit enforcement

- **Configuration:**
  - Stripe secret key configured in Supabase secrets
  - Price ID configured for subscription product

### Customer Experience
‚úÖ Users can subscribe via checkout flow  
‚úÖ Subscription status correctly determines scan limits  
‚úÖ Free users see "5 scans remaining" messaging  
‚úÖ Subscribed users have unlimited scans  
‚úÖ Users can manage billing via Stripe portal

## üü° PARTIALLY WORKING: Core User Features

### 1. Barcode Scanning

**What Works:**
- Camera access and permission handling (iOS/Android)
- ZXing barcode detection library integrated
- Scan result page UI complete
- Scan limit enforcement (free vs paid tiers)
- `ScanLimitModal` shows upgrade prompt when limit reached

**What Doesn't Work:**
- ‚ùå **Barcode-to-product resolution:** `resolve-barcode` edge function exists but `products` table is nearly empty (8 rows)
- ‚ùå **Product data:** No manufacturer/brand associations for most barcodes
- ‚ùå **Brand enrichment:** When a product is found, brand data is often incomplete

**Customer Experience:**
- ‚úÖ User can open camera and scan barcode
- ‚ùå Scan succeeds but resolves to "product not found" ~99% of the time
- ‚ùå If product found, brand profile often missing logo, events, or scores

**What's Needed:**
1. Seed `products` table with real UPC/EAN codes mapped to `brand_id`
2. Run `resolve-barcode` function to test end-to-end
3. Enrich brands with logos, descriptions, and events

---

### 2. Brand Search & Discovery

**What Works:**
- Search UI on `/search` route with fuzzy matching
- `search-brands` edge function uses trigram similarity
- Brand results show name, parent company, and score preview
- Trending brands list on homepage
- Category filters functional

**What Doesn't Work:**
- ‚ùå **Limited brand data:** Only 97 active brands in database
- ‚ùå **Missing aliases:** Many brands have consumer-facing names that don't match official corporate names
- ‚ùå **Incomplete profiles:** 40% missing logos, 7% missing parent company data

**Customer Experience:**
- ‚úÖ User can search for brands by name
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Search results limited to ~100 brands
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Common aliases (e.g., "Coke" ‚Üí "Coca-Cola Company") may not resolve
- ‚úÖ Clicking a result takes user to brand profile

**What's Needed:**
1. Expand brand catalog (Fortune 500 at minimum)
2. Add `brand_aliases` table for consumer-facing names
3. Run logo enrichment job
4. Populate parent company relationships

---

### 3. Brand Detail Pages

**What Works:**
- Brand profile UI (`/brand/:id`) displays:
  - Name, logo, description, website
  - Overall score + category breakdowns (labor, environment, politics, social)
  - Parent company ownership (if available)
  - Key people (executives, board members)
  - Shareholders (institutional ownership)
  - Event timeline (categorized evidence)
  - "Better Alternatives" card (if match < 70%)
  - "Why Should I Care" personalized bullets
  - Verification badges on events
  - Quick context summaries

- **Components Working:**
  - `ScoresGrid`: Displays 5 category scores with color coding
  - `EventTimeline`: Shows events filtered by category
  - `OwnershipTabs`: Displays corporate structure
  - `KeyPeopleSimple`: Lists executives
  - `TopShareholdersCard`: Shows institutional investors
  - `BetterAlternativesCard`: Suggests higher-match brands (NEW)
  - `WhyCareCard`: Explains score gaps in user's language (NEW)
  - `VerificationBadge`: Trust indicators for events (NEW)

**What Doesn't Work:**
- ‚ùå **Missing event data:** Most brands have <5 events total
- ‚ùå **Stale scores:** Scores can't update without events
- ‚ùå **Incomplete ownership:** Only 7% of brands have parent company mapped
- ‚ùå **Missing evidence sources:** Events often lack source URLs or attribution

**Customer Experience:**
- ‚úÖ User lands on brand profile and sees layout
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Scores are often default (50/100) because no events exist
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Event timeline shows "No events found" for most brands
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Ownership section shows "Unknown" for most brands
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** If user values are set, they see personalized "Why Care" bullets
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** If match is low, they see "Better Alternatives" suggestions
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Events show verification badges (Official, Verified, Reported)

**What's Needed:**
1. Run news ingestion for top 100 brands daily
2. Backfill historical events (90-day window minimum)
3. Run ownership enrichment (Wikidata ‚Üí `company_ownership` table)
4. Resolve missing logos and descriptions

---

### 4. User Preferences & Personalization

**What Works:**
- `/onboarding` flow asks users to set values on 4 sliders (labor, environment, politics, social)
- `user_preferences` table stores values per user
- `updateUserValues` function in `src/lib/userPreferences.ts` persists slider positions
- Scores are personalized based on user values via `personalized_brand_score` function
- "Why Should I Care" component references user values to explain gaps

**What Doesn't Work:**
- ‚ùå **No validation that preferences persist:** Need to verify slider changes actually save
- ‚ùå **No UI feedback on save success:** Users don't know if their values were saved

**Customer Experience:**
- ‚úÖ User sets values on onboarding
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Values may or may not persist (needs verification)
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** User sees personalized "Why Care" bullets on brand pages

**What's Needed:**
1. Add toast confirmation when preferences save
2. Add loading state to sliders during save
3. Verify `user_preferences` RLS policies allow upsert

---

## üî¥ NOT WORKING: Data Pipeline

### 1. Event Ingestion

**What Exists:**
- **Edge Functions:**
  - `fetch-news-events`: Generic news fetcher
  - `fetch-google-news-rss`: Google News RSS parser
  - `fetch-guardian-news`: Guardian API integration
  - `fetch-reddit-rss`: Reddit RSS fetcher
  - `fetch-epa-events`: EPA violations
  - `fetch-fec-events`: Political donations
  - `fetch-osha-events`: Workplace safety
  - `ingest-fda-recalls`: FDA product recalls
  - `unified-news-orchestrator`: Coordinates all news sources

**What Doesn't Work:**
- ‚ùå **Not running automatically:** No cron jobs configured to trigger daily
- ‚ùå **No manual trigger UI:** Admins can't manually run ingestion
- ‚ùå **Rate limits not configured:** Could hit API limits if run too frequently
- ‚ùå **No deduplication:** Same event may be ingested multiple times

**Customer Impact:**
- ‚ùå Users see stale or missing events on brand pages
- ‚ùå Scores remain at default (50) because no events exist to modify them

**What's Needed:**
1. Set up cron jobs to run `unified-news-orchestrator` daily
2. Configure rate limits (max 10 brands/day for free tier APIs)
3. Add deduplication logic in `brand_events` table (unique constraint on `brand_id + title + event_date`)
4. Create admin UI to manually trigger ingestion for specific brands

---

### 2. Score Calculation

**What Exists:**
- **Edge Functions:**
  - `calculate-brand-score`: Calculates scores from events
  - `simple-brand-scorer`: Simplified scoring logic
  - `bulk-calculate-scores`: Batch score updates
  
- **Database Function:**
  - `compute_brand_score`: SQL function that calculates scores from `brand_events` table

- **Scoring Logic:**
  - Baseline: 50/100 (neutral)
  - Events modify score based on:
    - Category (labor, environment, politics, social)
    - Severity (minor, moderate, severe, catastrophic)
    - Verification (official > corroborated > reported)
    - Recency (events decay over time)

**What Doesn't Work:**
- ‚ùå **Not running automatically:** Scores don't update when events are added
- ‚ùå **No trigger:** No database trigger to recalculate when `brand_events` changes
- ‚ùå **Manual recalculation required:** Admins must manually run scorer

**Customer Impact:**
- ‚ùå Users see stale scores that don't reflect recent events
- ‚ùå New events don't change brand scores until manual recalc

**What's Needed:**
1. Add database trigger on `brand_events` INSERT/UPDATE to queue score recalc
2. Set up cron job to run `simple-brand-scorer` nightly
3. Add admin UI button to manually recalculate scores for a brand

---

### 3. Brand Enrichment

**What Exists:**
- **Edge Functions:**
  - `enrich-brand-wiki`: Fetches data from Wikidata
  - `enrich-ownership`: Populates `company_ownership` table
  - `enrich-key-people`: Fetches executives and board members
  - `enrich-shareholders`: Fetches institutional ownership
  - `resolve-brand-logo`: Finds and uploads brand logos
  - `enrich-company-profile`: General profile enrichment

**What Works:**
- ‚úÖ Functions can successfully fetch data when manually invoked
- ‚úÖ Wikidata integration functional
- ‚úÖ Logo resolution works for most brands

**What Doesn't Work:**
- ‚ùå **Not running automatically:** Enrichment only happens on manual trigger
- ‚ùå **Inconsistent data:** 40% missing logos, 7% missing parent company
- ‚ùå **No prioritization:** No system to enrich high-traffic brands first

**Customer Impact:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Users see incomplete brand profiles (missing logos, descriptions, ownership)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Parent company relationships not displayed

**What's Needed:**
1. Run one-time enrichment job for all active brands
2. Set up weekly cron to enrich new brands
3. Prioritize enrichment for brands with high scan volume

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

**What's Solid:**
- Frontend UX is polished and ready
- Authentication and user management work correctly
- Stripe integration is production-ready
- Admin tools provide good visibility
- Database schema is well-designed and secure

**What's Blocking Launch:**
- Products table is empty (blocks barcode scanning)
- Event ingestion isn't automated (blocks score updates)
- Brand catalog is too small (blocks search utility)

**Bottom Line:** The system architecture is sound. We need seed data and automated pipelines to make it function end-to-end.
