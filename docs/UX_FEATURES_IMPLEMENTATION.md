# UX Features Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented 4 critical UX features to improve the scanning experience, converting confusion into actionable insights.

## Features Shipped

### 1. ✅ Better Alternatives Card
**Priority:** Ship First  
**Status:** Implemented & Integrated

**What it does:**
- Shows 2-3 better-aligned brands when current match is <70%
- Displays improvement delta (e.g., "+15 match points")
- Color-coded badges (green 80+, blue 70+, yellow <70)
- "Why" bullets explain the improvement
- Direct "View Brand" and "Compare" actions

**Files:**
- `src/components/BetterAlternativesCard.tsx` - Main component
- `src/pages/ScanResult.tsx` - Integration (lines 724-737)

**Analytics tracked:**
- `alt_shown` - When card displays
- `alt_clicked` - When user clicks "View Brand"
- `compare_clicked` - When user clicks "Compare"

**Acceptance criteria:**
✅ Only shows when match < 70%  
✅ Returns 1-3 items (filters out worse matches)  
✅ Shows improvement delta  
✅ No empty state (hides if no better alternatives)

### 2. ✅ Why Should I Care
**Priority:** Second  
**Status:** Implemented & Integrated

**What it does:**
- Generates 2-3 personalized bullets explaining score gaps
- Only references categories user cares about (>20 points from neutral)
- Shows gap size, direction, and plain-language explanation
- Links to evidence for each category

**Files:**
- `src/lib/whyCare.ts` - Logic for generating bullets
- `src/components/WhyCareCard.tsx` - UI component
- `src/pages/ScanResult.tsx` - Integration (lines 676-696)

**Example output:**
```
23-point gap on workers & labor practices
→ You value workers & labor practices more than this brand delivers
→ Show evidence
```

**Analytics tracked:**
- `why_shown` - When card displays with bullet count and categories

**Acceptance criteria:**
✅ Only shows categories user cares about  
✅ No generic text if all sliders ≈50 (shows neutral explainer)  
✅ Sorted by gap size, top 3

---

### 3. ✅ Verification Badges
**Priority:** Fourth  
**Status:** Implemented

**What it does:**
- Visual trust indicators for every event
- 4 levels: Official, Verified, Reported, Disputed
- Tooltips explain criteria
- Shows source domain chip

**Files:**
- `src/components/VerificationBadge.tsx` - Reusable badge component
- `src/components/EventCard.tsx` - Already has inline badges (enhanced with tooltips)

**Badge types:**
- **Official** (green): Government filings, court docs
- **Verified** (blue): ≥2 reputable sources
- **Reported** (outline): Single source
- **Disputed** (red): Conflicting reports

**Analytics tracked:**
- `badge_hover` - When user hovers for tooltip

**Acceptance criteria:**
✅ Badge matches verification field 1:1  
✅ Tooltip explains criteria  
✅ No cross-category bleed

---

### 4. ✅ Quick Context Summaries
**Priority:** Third  
**Status:** Implemented

**What it does:**
- One-line summaries above event titles
- Format: "Category: Clean title"
- Strips "Breaking:", "Update:" prefixes
- Truncates at 90 chars with ellipsis

**Files:**
- `src/lib/eventSummary.ts` - Summary generation logic
- `src/components/EventCard.tsx` - Integration (line 468-470)

**Example:**
```
Labor: OSHA citations for worker safety violations
```

**Analytics tracked:**
- `summary_view` - When event card renders with summary

**Acceptance criteria:**
✅ Works offline, deterministic  
✅ No hallucinations (derived from existing fields)  
✅ Under 90 chars

---

## Analytics Implementation

**Local storage tracking** (ready for backend integration):
- All events stored in `analytics_queue` localStorage
- Max 100 events kept
- Console logging in development mode

**Tracked events:**
1. `alt_shown` - Alternatives card displayed
2. `alt_clicked` - Alternative brand clicked
3. `compare_clicked` - Compare initiated
4. `why_shown` - "Why Care" card displayed
5. `badge_hover` - Verification badge hovered
6. `summary_view` - Event summary viewed

**Files:**
- `src/lib/analytics.ts` - Analytics helper

**Next steps for analytics:**
- Connect to analytics backend (Posthog, Mixpanel, etc.)
- Add A/B flag for alternatives threshold (70 vs 75)

## Testing Checklist

### Better Alternatives
- [ ] Scan product with <70% match
- [ ] Verify 1-3 alternatives show
- [ ] Click "View Brand" (should navigate)
- [ ] Click "Compare" (should open comparison sheet)
- [ ] Verify improvement delta is correct

### Why Should I Care
- [ ] Set value sliders in Settings (not all at 50)
- [ ] Scan product with gaps in your priority categories
- [ ] Verify 2-3 bullets show
- [ ] Click "Show evidence" link
- [ ] Verify no bullets if all sliders ≈50

### Verification Badges
- [ ] View events in brand profile
- [ ] Hover over verification badges
- [ ] Verify tooltip explains criteria
- [ ] Check Official (EPA, OSHA), Verified (2+ sources), Reported badges

### Quick Summaries
- [ ] View brand events
- [ ] Verify summary line shows above title
- [ ] Verify "Breaking:" prefix is stripped
- [ ] Verify long titles truncate at 90 chars

---

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current
- Analytics stored locally only (not sent to backend)
- No A/B testing flag for threshold yet
- Alternatives computed on-the-fly (no pre-computation)

### Future Enhancements
1. Add alternatives threshold A/B flag (70 vs 75)
2. Connect analytics to backend
3. Add price context to alternatives (when available)
4. Pre-compute alternatives for faster load
5. Add "Save as favorite" action
6. Show alternatives in category context (not just product category)

├── BetterAlternativesCard (NEW)
│   └── filters alternatives, tracks clicks
└── EventCard (enhanced)
    ├── VerificationBadge (NEW component option)

---

## Rollout Plan

✅ **Day 1**: Better Alternatives + Why Care on scan result  
✅ **Day 2**: Add Badges + Summaries in event feed  

**Environment flag** (optional):
Add to `src/config/features.ts`:
```typescript
export const FEATURES = {
  betterAlternatives: true,
  whyCare: true,
  verificationBadges: true,
  eventSummaries: true,
};
```

---

## QA Fixtures

Test with these brands:
1. **Johnson & Johnson** - Social category only (test single-category gap)
2. **Starbucks** - Mixed scores (test multiple gaps)
3. **Unilever** - Good match (test no alternatives shown)

---

## Performance Notes

- All helpers are pure functions (no API calls)
- Alternatives computed on-the-fly (cached by React Query)
- Event summaries deterministic (no LLM)
- Analytics batched in localStorage (no network overhead)

---

## Questions / Feedback

File issues for:
- Bug reports
- Analytics not tracking
