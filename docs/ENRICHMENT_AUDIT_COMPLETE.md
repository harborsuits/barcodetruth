# ✅ Parent Company & Key People Enrichment - Audit Complete

## Executive Summary

All critical fixes to the enrichment system are complete. The system now correctly extracts and stores parent company relationships, key people, and SEC ticker mappings from Wikidata with full observability and data hygiene guardrails.

---

## 🔧 Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Role Name Canonicalization** ✅
**Problem**: Role mismatch between database storage and UI expectations  
**Fix**: Roles now stored as `chief_executive_officer`, `chairperson`, `founder` (snake_case)  
**Impact**: Key people display correctly in UI with proper labels

### 2. **Rich Parent Company Data** ✅
**Problem**: Parent companies created with minimal data  
**Fix**: Now extracts Wikipedia description, country (P17), public status (P414), ticker (P249)  
**Impact**: Parent company cards show comprehensive context

### 3. **Ticker Property Detection** ✅
**Problem**: Incorrect Wikidata property checks for stock tickers  
**Fix**: Checks both P414 (stock exchange) and P249 (ticker symbol + qualifiers)  
**Impact**: Public companies correctly identified, SEC feeds auto-enabled

### 4. **Clickable People Links** ✅
**Problem**: No way to verify or learn more about executives  
**Fix**: Executive cards link to Wikidata profiles using `person_qid`  
**Impact**: Users can verify data quality and explore further

### 5. **Confidence Scoring** ✅
**Problem**: No quality indicator for people data  
**Fix**: Confidence = 0.9 (QID + image), 0.8 (QID only), 0.6 (neither)  
**Impact**: Filter low-quality data, track enrichment quality

## 🛡️ Data Hygiene Guardrails

### Unique Constraints
```sql
-- Prevent duplicate people
ALTER TABLE company_people 
  ADD CONSTRAINT company_people_company_person_role_unique 
  UNIQUE (company_id, person_qid, role);

-- Prevent duplicate ticker mappings  
ALTER TABLE brand_data_mappings 
  ADD CONSTRAINT brand_data_mappings_brand_source_label_unique 
  UNIQUE (brand_id, source, label);
```

### Backfill Existing Data
```sql
-- Canonicalize old role names
UPDATE company_people SET role='chief_executive_officer' WHERE role IN ('CEO','Chief Executive Officer');
UPDATE company_people SET role='chairperson' WHERE role IN ('Chairperson','Chairman','Chair');
UPDATE company_people SET role='founder' WHERE role IN ('Founder');
```

## 📊 Observability

### Enrichment Runs Tracking
New table `enrichment_runs` tracks every enrichment attempt with:
- `parent_found`, `people_added`, `ticker_added`, `logo_found`, `country_found`
- `description_length` (chars of Wikipedia extract)
- `properties_found[]` (which Wikidata properties were extracted)
- `duration_ms` (performance tracking)
- `error_message` (failure reasons)

### Admin Dashboard
**Route**: `/admin/enrichment`

Real-time monitoring showing:
- **24h Stats**: Total runs, parents found, people added, tickers added
- **Recent Runs**: Last 50 enrichments with detailed metrics
- **Success/Failure**: Visual indicators and error messages
- **Batch Trigger**: One-click batch enrichment

## 🎨 UI Enhancements

### Parent Company Card
- 📈 **Public indicator**: "Public • NASDAQ:MSFT" badge
- 🌍 **Country**: Displayed with globe icon
- 📄 **Description**: Full Wikipedia extract
- 🔗 **Wikidata link**: "Learn more about {company}" link
- ✅ **Source attribution**: Confidence % tooltip

### Key People Row
- 👤 **Executive cards**: CEO and Chairperson with avatars
- 👥 **Founders group**: Stacked avatars (max 3 shown)
- 🔗 **Clickable**: Links to Wikidata profiles
- 🏷️ **Roles**: CEO, Chair, Founder labels
- 📷 **Images**: Profile photos from Wikimedia Commons

## 🔍 Verification Queries

### Check Parent Enrichment
```sql
SELECT 
  b.name as brand_name,
  co.parent_name,
  c.country,
  c.is_public,
  c.ticker,
  LENGTH(c.description) as desc_len,
  c.logo_url IS NOT NULL as has_logo
FROM brands b
JOIN company_ownership co ON co.child_brand_id = b.id
LEFT JOIN companies c ON c.id = co.parent_company_id
WHERE b.id = 'BRAND_UUID';
```

### Check Key People
```sql
SELECT 
  cp.role,
  cp.person_name,
  cp.person_qid,
  cp.image_url IS NOT NULL as has_image,
  cp.confidence
FROM company_people cp
JOIN company_ownership co ON co.parent_company_id = cp.company_id
WHERE co.child_brand_id = 'BRAND_UUID'
ORDER BY role, person_name;
```

### Check Ticker Mappings
```sql
SELECT * FROM brand_data_mappings
WHERE brand_id = 'BRAND_UUID' 
  AND source = 'sec' 
  AND label = 'ticker';
```

## 📋 Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Brand == Company
If brand is the company (no parent), enrichment:
- Creates company entry for brand itself
- Associates key people with brand's company record
- Prevents orphan data

### 2. Multiple Parents
- Selects highest confidence parent from `company_ownership`
- Logs other relationships for manual review
- Prevents data confusion

### 3. Missing/Ambiguous QIDs
- Gracefully skips entities without clear Wikidata matches
- Logs attempts for debugging
- No partial/broken records created

### 4. Public Without Ticker
- Only creates SEC mapping when BOTH P414 (exchange) AND P249 (ticker) present
- Avoids false positives
- Prevents broken SEC feed attempts

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Do Now)
1. **Run batch enrichment**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "$SUPABASE_URL/functions/v1/bulk-enrich-brands" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
   ```

2. **Monitor in admin dashboard**: Visit `/admin/enrichment`

3. **Spot-check results**: Use verification queries on known brands

### Soon (This Week)
1. **Add logo resolution**: Extend enrichment to fetch company logos from Wikimedia
2. **Historical tracking**: Track ownership/leadership changes over time  
3. **Batch logo fetch**: Run `batch-resolve-logos` for parent companies
4. **Coverage dashboard**: Add coverage metrics to admin dashboard

### Later (Next Sprint)
1. **CEO turnover detection**: Alert when CEO changes
2. **Ownership change alerts**: Notify on M&A activity
3. **Confidence weighting**: Use confidence scores in ranking/display
4. **Auto-refresh**: Periodic re-enrichment for stale data (>90 days)
