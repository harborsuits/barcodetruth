# Parent Company & Key People Fixes - Summary

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Role Name Mismatch (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Key people roles were stored as display names ("CEO", "Chairperson", "Founder") but the RPC function and UI expected database-friendly snake_case names ("chief_executive_officer", "chairperson", "founder").

**Impact**: Key people data wouldn't display in the UI even when present in the database.

**Fix**: Updated `enrich-brand-wiki/index.ts` to store roles as:
- `chief_executive_officer` (not "CEO")
- `chairperson` (not "Chairperson")  
- `founder` (not "Founder")

**Location**: `supabase/functions/enrich-brand-wiki/index.ts` lines 430-435

---

### 2. ‚ùå Parent Company Missing Rich Data
**Problem**: When creating parent companies, only name and wikidata_qid were saved. No Wikipedia description, country, or other metadata.

**Impact**: Parent company cards showed incomplete information, reducing user trust and value.

**Fix**: Extended parent company creation to fetch:
- Wikipedia description (full extract)
- Country (P17 property)
- Wikipedia title for future reference
- Public/private status and ticker

**Location**: `supabase/functions/enrich-brand-wiki/index.ts` lines 352-398

---

### 3. ‚ùå Incorrect Ticker Property
**Problem**: Used P249 directly for ticker symbol, but this property is often used as a qualifier of P414 (stock exchange).

**Impact**: Public companies weren't correctly identified, SEC feeds weren't auto-enabled.

**Fix**: Now checks:
1. P414 (stock exchange) to determine if public
2. P249 as direct property OR as P414 qualifier
3. Updates company record with both `is_public` and `ticker`

**Location**: `supabase/functions/enrich-brand-wiki/index.ts` lines 393-424

---

### 4. ‚ùå Missing Person QID in UI
**Problem**: RPC function didn't return `person_qid` field, so UI couldn't create clickable Wikidata links.

**Impact**: Users couldn't verify or learn more about executives and founders.

**Fix**: 
- Updated `get_brand_company_info()` RPC to include `person_qid` in return value
- Updated `KeyPeopleRow` component to make executive cards clickable links to Wikidata

**Location**: 
- Database: Migration `20251022000000_fix_company_info_person_qid.sql`
- UI: `src/components/brand/KeyPeopleRow.tsx` lines 43-69

---

### 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Role Mapping Edge Cases
**Problem**: If old data exists with display names, it wouldn't render correctly.

**Impact**: Mixed data sources could cause inconsistent display.

**Fix**: Added fallback mappings in `KeyPeopleRow` component:
```typescript
const roleLabels: Record<string, string> = {
  chief_executive_officer: "CEO",
  chairperson: "Chair",
  chairman: "Chair",  // variant
  founder: "Founder",
  // Fallback for old data
  CEO: "CEO",
  Chairperson: "Chair",
  Founder: "Founder"
};
```

**Location**: `src/components/brand/KeyPeopleRow.tsx` lines 13-24

## New Features Added

### 1. ‚úÖ Clickable People Cards
Executive and founder cards now link to their Wikidata profiles when clicked, allowing users to verify and learn more.

### 2. ‚úÖ Comprehensive Parent Metadata
Parent companies now show:
- Full Wikipedia description
- Country of incorporation
- Public/private status with ticker and exchange
- Logo (when available)

### 3. ‚úÖ Auto SEC Feed Enablement
When a parent company is public with a ticker, the brand automatically gets:
- `brand_data_mappings` entry with SEC ticker
- Future SEC EDGAR filings linked to brand events
- Regulatory data flowing automatically

---

## Testing & Validation

### SQL Queries for Validation
Created `scripts/test_ownership_enrichment.sql` with queries to:
1. Find brands ready for enrichment
2. Verify parent company data completeness
3. Check key people with images
4. Validate role names are correct
5. Confirm SEC ticker mappings

### Documentation
Created `docs/OWNERSHIP_ENRICHMENT_GUIDE.md` with:
- Complete data flow diagram
- Wikidata property reference
- UI component breakdown
- Troubleshooting guide
- Example test commands

## Data Quality Improvements

### Before
```
Parent Company: Unilever
‚îî‚îÄ No description
‚îî‚îÄ No country
‚îî‚îÄ Unknown if public
‚îî‚îÄ No key people
```

### After
```
Parent Company: Unilever
‚îú‚îÄ Description: "Unilever is a British multinational consumer goods company..."
‚îú‚îÄ Country: United Kingdom
‚îú‚îÄ Status: Public (LON: ULVR)
‚îî‚îÄ Key People:
    ‚îú‚îÄ Hein Schumacher (CEO)
    ‚îú‚îÄ Nils Andersen (Chair)
    ‚îî‚îÄ 2 Founders (William Lever, James Lever)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run batch enrichment**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "$SUPABASE_URL/functions/v1/bulk-enrich-brands" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
   ```

2. **Fix existing data** with wrong role names:
   ```sql
   UPDATE company_people 
   SET role = 'chief_executive_officer' 
   WHERE role = 'CEO';
   
   UPDATE company_people 
   SET role = 'chairperson' 
   WHERE role IN ('Chairperson', 'Chairman');
   
   UPDATE company_people 
   SET role = 'founder' 
   WHERE role = 'Founder';
   ```

3. **Verify enrichment** with test queries in `scripts/test_ownership_enrichment.sql`

4. **Monitor coverage**:
   - Track % of brands with parent companies
   - Track % of parent companies with key people
   - Track % of public companies with tickers

## Success Metrics

Track these to measure improvement:

1. **Coverage**: % of brands with parent company data
2. **Completeness**: % of parent companies with descriptions
3. **People**: Average # of key people per parent company  
4. **Public Status**: % of parent companies correctly tagged as public

Expected targets after full enrichment:
- Coverage: >70%
- Completeness: >80%
- People: >2 per company
- Public Status: >95% accuracy
