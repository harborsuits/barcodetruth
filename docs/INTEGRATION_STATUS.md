```

## ðŸš€ Immediate Action Items

### 1. Manual Seed Test (15 minutes)

Run the test script:
```bash
export SUPABASE_URL="https://midmvcwtywnexzdwbekp.supabase.co"
export SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key"

# Run all tests
bash docs/RSS_MANUAL_TEST.sh

# Or test individual sources
curl -X POST "$SUPABASE_URL/functions/v1/fetch-google-news-rss?brand_id=5e7f728b-d485-43ce-b82e-ed7c606f01d2" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
```

Expected results:
- Google News: 10-20 events inserted per brand
- Reddit: 5-15 events inserted per brand
- SEC EDGAR: 3-10 filings inserted per brand (varies by activity)

### 2. Verify UI (5 minutes)

After manual seed:
1. Visit `/brand/5e7f728b-d485-43ce-b82e-ed7c606f01d2` (Kroger)
2. Check EventCard components show source chips
3. Verify verification badges (Official for SEC, Unverified for News/Reddit)
4. Visit `/admin/rss-monitor` to see stats

### 3. Run Validation Queries

```sql
-- Should show events from all 3 sources
SELECT es.source_name, COUNT(*) AS event_count, MAX(e.created_at) AS last_insert
FROM brand_events e
JOIN event_sources es ON es.event_id=e.event_id
WHERE es.source_name IN ('Google News','Reddit','SEC EDGAR')
GROUP BY es.source_name;

-- Should return 0 rows (no duplicates)
SELECT brand_id, source_url, COUNT(*) 
FROM brand_events
WHERE source_url IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY brand_id, source_url
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### 4. Set Up Cron Jobs

**IMPORTANT:** Edit `docs/RSS_CRON_MANUAL_SETUP.sql` and replace `YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` with your actual key, then run it in your database.

Schedules:
- Google News: Hourly at :05
- Reddit: Hourly at :25  
- SEC EDGAR: Daily at 8 AM UTC

Each processes 20 brands (News/Reddit) or 50 brands (SEC) with 2s delays between calls.

### 5. Test Parent Company Enrichment

```bash
# Trigger enrichment for Kroger (should add Kroger parent + execs)
curl -X POST "$SUPABASE_URL/functions/v1/enrich-brand-wiki?brand_id=5e7f728b-d485-43ce-b82e-ed7c606f01d2" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"

# Check results
SELECT * FROM company_ownership WHERE child_brand_id = '5e7f728b-d485-43ce-b82e-ed7c606f01d2';
SELECT * FROM company_people WHERE company_id IN (
  SELECT parent_company_id FROM company_ownership 
  WHERE child_brand_id = '5e7f728b-d485-43ce-b82e-ed7c606f01d2'
);
```

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics (24h After Cron)

- [ ] Google News: 400+ events/day across all brands
- [ ] Reddit: 400+ events/day across all brands
- [ ] SEC EDGAR: 5-10 filings/day
- [ ] Zero duplicates (validation query returns 0)
- [ ] All sources "active" in monitor (<2h since last insert)
- [ ] Parent companies populated for top brands
- [ ] Key people (CEO/Chair/Founders) populated with images

## ðŸŽ¯ Near-Term Improvements

### Quick Wins (1-2 days)
1. **Google News Canonical URL Resolver**
   - Parse news.google.com redirects to get publisher URL
   - Improves cross-outlet deduplication

2. **Source Credibility Table**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS source_credibility (
     source_name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
     credibility_score NUMERIC NOT NULL CHECK (credibility_score >= 0 AND credibility_score <= 1),
     kind TEXT NOT NULL
   );
   
   INSERT INTO source_credibility VALUES
   ('SEC EDGAR', 0.95, 'government'),
   ('Google News', 0.50, 'aggregator'),
   ('Reddit', 0.35, 'social_media');
   ```

3. **Alert System**
   - Log when source has 0 inserts for 3 consecutive runs
   - Track rate limit hits
   - Monitor function errors

### Medium Priority (Week 2)
1. **Batch Enrichment Runner**
   - Auto-enrich all brands missing parent/people data
   - Run weekly to catch new brands

2. **Enhanced UI Cards**
   - "Parent Company" card with logo + confidence
   - "Key People" row with headshots
   - Market cap chip (if available from Wikidata P2139)

3. **Deep Scan Trigger**
   - After enrichment, trigger news search including:
     - Brand name
     - Parent company name
     - Key people names (CEO, Chair)
   - Surfaces governance & exec-related stories

## ðŸŽ“ How It Works

### Data Flow
```
1. Cron triggers edge function (hourly/daily)
   â†“
2. Edge function fetches RSS/Atom feed
   â†“
3. RSS parser normalizes items
   â†“
4. Categorization engine processes title/summary
   â†“
5. Relevance scorer assigns 0-20 score
   â†“
6. Dedup check (brand_id + source_url)
   â†“
7. Insert into brand_events + event_sources
   â†“
8. UI displays with source chips + verification badges
```

### Enrichment Flow
```
1. User views brand OR batch enrichment runs
   â†“
2. enrich-brand-wiki checks for Wikipedia description
   â†“
3. Searches Wikidata for entity QID
   â†“
4. Fetches Wikipedia extract
   â†“
5. Updates brand/company description
   â†“
6. **NEW:** Extracts parent organization (P749)
   â†“
7. **NEW:** Creates company_ownership relationship
   â†“
8. **NEW:** Extracts key people (CEO, Chair, Founders)
   â†“
9. **NEW:** Stores in company_people with images
   â†“
10. **NEW:** If parent has ticker, adds SEC mapping
```

## ðŸš¨ Known Limitations

1. **Google News**: Links are redirects, need canonical URL resolution
2. **Reddit**: Low credibility, good for early signals only
3. **SEC EDGAR**: Requires manual ticker configuration per brand
4. **Wikidata**: Some brands may not have parent/people data
5. **Rate Limits**: Free APIs but need throttling (already implemented)

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Coverage Boost

**Current state (API-based news only):**
- ~50-100 events/day across all brands
- Limited by API quotas (Guardian, NYT, etc.)

**After RSS integrations:**
- ~800-1000 events/day
- Free, unlimited (no API quotas)
- Better breadth (Reddit social signals, SEC official docs)

**After parent/people enrichment:**
- Auto-enables SEC feed for subsidiaries
- Better keyword matching (exec names, parent company)
- "Who owns whom" transparency

## ðŸŽ‰ What You've Achieved

You now have:
1. **3 free, unlimited news sources** feeding your system 24/7
2. **Proper deduplication** preventing spam
3. **Source credibility signals** (Official vs Unverified)
4. **Real-time monitoring** dashboard
5. **Parent company tracking** for transparency
6. **Key people extraction** for governance context
7. **Automatic SEC ticker discovery** for subsidiaries

Next step: **Test it!** Run the manual seed script and watch the data flow in.
