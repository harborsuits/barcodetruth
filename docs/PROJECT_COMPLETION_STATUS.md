## 🚀 Ready for Production

### Immediate Actions Required (15-30 min)

1. **Manual Seed Test** (verify RSS feeds work):
   ```bash
   bash docs/RSS_MANUAL_TEST.sh
   ```

2. **Set Up Cron Jobs** (automate ingestion):
   - Edit `docs/RSS_CRON_MANUAL_SETUP.sql`
   - Replace `YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` with actual key
   - Run SQL in database

3. **Verify UI**:
   - Visit a brand profile (e.g., Kroger, Walmart, Target)
   - Check for source chips and verification badges
   - Confirm parent company card renders
   - Verify key people display with avatars
   - Visit `/admin/rss-monitor` to see real-time stats

4. **Run Validation Queries**:
   ```sql
   -- Check events by source (should see rows)
   SELECT es.source_name, COUNT(*) 
   FROM brand_events e
   JOIN event_sources es ON es.event_id = e.event_id
   WHERE es.source_name IN ('Google News','Reddit','SEC EDGAR')
   GROUP BY es.source_name;

   -- Check for duplicates (should return 0)
   SELECT brand_id, source_url, COUNT(*) 
   FROM brand_events
   WHERE source_url IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY brand_id, source_url
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   ```

### Cron Schedule (After Setup)

- **Google News RSS**: Hourly at :05
- **Reddit RSS**: Hourly at :25
- **SEC EDGAR**: Daily at 8 AM UTC

Each job processes 20-50 brands with 2s delays between calls.

## 📊 Expected Results (24h After Cron)

### Volume
- **Google News**: 400+ events/day across all brands
- **Reddit**: 400+ events/day across all brands  
- **SEC EDGAR**: 5-10 filings/day
- **Total**: ~800-1000 events/day (vs. ~50-100 before)

### Quality
- **Zero duplicates** (enforced by unique index)
- **All sources active** (<2h since last insert)
- **Proper categorization** (Product Safety, Regulatory, Legal, Labor, etc.)
- **Correct verification** (SEC=Official, News/Social=Unverified)

### Enrichment
- **Parent companies populated** for major brands
- **Key people added** (CEO, Chair, Founders with images)
- **SEC tickers auto-configured** for subsidiaries of public parents

## 🎯 Success Criteria

## 🔍 Quick Health Checks

### 1. RSS Feed Health
```sql
-- Last insert per source
SELECT 
  es.source_name,
  COUNT(*) AS events_last_24h,
  MAX(e.created_at) AS last_insert,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - MAX(e.created_at)))/3600 AS hours_since_last
FROM brand_events e
JOIN event_sources es ON es.event_id = e.event_id
WHERE e.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
  AND es.source_name IN ('Google News','Reddit','SEC EDGAR')
GROUP BY es.source_name;
```

### 2. Enrichment Health
```sql
-- Brands with parent company data
SELECT COUNT(*) AS brands_with_parents
FROM company_ownership;

-- Brands with key people data
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT company_id) AS companies_with_people
FROM company_people;

-- Auto-configured SEC tickers
SELECT COUNT(*) AS auto_tickers
FROM brand_data_mappings
WHERE source = 'sec' AND label = 'ticker';
```

### 3. Coverage Boost
```sql
-- Events by source (7 days)
SELECT 
  COALESCE(es.source_name, 'Legacy') AS source,
  COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM brand_events e
LEFT JOIN event_sources es ON es.event_id = e.event_id
WHERE e.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY source
ORDER BY event_count DESC;
```
